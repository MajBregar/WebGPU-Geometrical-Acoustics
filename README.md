# WebGPU Geometrical Acoustics
A simple WebGPU-based simulation of geometrical acoustics. 


# TODO
- READ PAPER MORE IN DEPTH - make sound rays physically accurate
- implement sound transform into energy bands as input vectors
- hook up vector input to compute shader
- implement sound detransform from listener energy bands into sound

- IF HAVE TIME - implement head transfer function for listener
