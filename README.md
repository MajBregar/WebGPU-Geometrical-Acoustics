# WebGPU Geometrical Acoustics
A simple WebGPU-based simulation of geometrical acoustics. 

# URGENT TODO
- FIX SAMPLE RATE BEING HARDCODED
- CORRECT MATERIAL COEFFICIENTS
- FIX REFLECTION NORMALIZATION

# TODO
- MAKE DIFFRACTION
- MAKE INTERFERRENCE

# VALIDATION
- how to test energy conservation
- correct energy changes according to equations
- how to test distance correctiveness
